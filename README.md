## Synopsis 

Since a few years, I have been teaching a various introductory course on Bayesian statistics together with Jörn Pagel, [Joseph Chipperfield](http://josephchipperfield.wordpress.com/) and Björn Reineking. Typical topics we cover include 


* Introduction to the concepts of Bayesian statistics (Priors, Likelihoods, etc.)
* The Bugs model language and its implementations in JAGS, STAN and OpenBugs
* Specifying Bayesian models
  * Linear models, generalized linear models, mixed models
  * Spatial models 
  * State-space models 
* Sampling methods (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo)
* Analyzing Bayesian outputs
  * Interpreting MCMC results
  * Posterior predictive checks
  * Predictions
  * Bayesian model selection and model averaging
* Approximate Bayesian Computation

I will announce any upcoming courses [at my blog](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/).

## Lecture notes and code

I'm workin on providing proper lecture notes for this course. For the moment, I'm recommending as an introduction the free lecture notes

* [Bayesian Basics by Michael Clark](http://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/learn/IntroBayes.pdf)

I have a collection of commented code examples on concepts and applications of Bayesian statistics here [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode)

For further reading see the textbooks and articles suggested [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/LectureNotes/readings.md)
