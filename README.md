## Learning by reading 

I'm workin on providing proper lecture notes for this course. For the moment, I'm recommending as an introduction the free lecture notes

* [Bayesian Basics by Michael Clark](http://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/learn/IntroBayes.pdf)

For further reading see the textbooks and articles suggested [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/LectureNotes/readings.md)

Various code examples are provided [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode)
