### Software

* Biips is a general software for Bayesian inference with interacting particle systems, a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. It aims at popularizing the use of these methods to non-statistician researchers and students, thanks to its automated “black box” inference engine. [website](https://alea.bordeaux.inria.fr/biips/doku.php) 

* LibBi is used for state-space modelling and Bayesian inference on high-performance computer hardware, including multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs (graphics processing units) and distributed-memory clusters. http://libbi.org/
