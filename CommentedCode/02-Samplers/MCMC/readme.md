## Software for MCMC sampling

For statistical applications, most people use Bugs, Jags or Stan. If you know nothing, I would recommend starting with Jags. 

If you want a sampler that is able to sample from a general target distribution, a number of options are available. A large range of samplers is in the package Laplaces Demon. If you want to compare samplers or learn about different ones, I would start there. 

Packages that implement one or a small number of samplers include 

* adaptMCMC http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adaptMCMC/ (adaptive MH)
