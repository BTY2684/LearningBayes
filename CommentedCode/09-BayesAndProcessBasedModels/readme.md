Fitting complex or process-based models
===

In principle, there is nothing different when comparing 
 

## How to do this 

### Preparing compiled models to 

See [LinkingAModelToR.md](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/CommentedCode/09-BayesAndProcessBasedModels/LinkingAModelToR.md)

### Defining fit

How should we measure how well the model fits to the data? There are different options 

* Ad hoc objectives
* Likelihood
* Posterior = Likelihood + Prior

### Getting best fit and uncertainties 

In general, all the approaches using optimization, MCMC and sensitivity analysis in this collection of tuturials are valid for forest models as well, and it's worth looking at them. In particular, also ABC approaches may be interesting to look at. Some references particular to forest models are:
