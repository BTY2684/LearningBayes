{"name":"Learningbayes","tagline":"Teaching material for Bayesian Statistics","body":"## Synopsis \r\n\r\nSince a few years, I have been teaching a various introductory course on Bayesian statistics together with Jörn Pagel, [Joseph Chipperfield](http://josephchipperfield.wordpress.com/) and Björn Reineking. Typical topics we cover include \r\n\r\n\r\n* Introduction to the concepts of Bayesian statistics (Priors, Likelihoods, etc.)\r\n* The Bugs model language and its implementations in JAGS, STAN and OpenBugs\r\n* Specifying Bayesian models\r\n  * Linear models, generalized linear models, mixed models\r\n  * Spatial models \r\n  * State-space models \r\n* Sampling methods (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo)\r\n* Analyzing Bayesian outputs\r\n  * Interpreting MCMC results\r\n  * Posterior predictive checks\r\n  * Predictions\r\n  * Bayesian model selection and model averaging\r\n* Approximate Bayesian Computation\r\n\r\n## Lecture notes\r\n\r\nI'm workin on providing proper lecture notes for this course. For the moment, I'm recommending as an introduction the free lecture notes\r\n\r\n* [Bayesian Basics by Michael Clark](http://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/learn/IntroBayes.pdf)\r\n\r\nFor further reading see the textbooks and articles suggested [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/LectureNotes/readings.md)\r\n\r\n## Code examples\r\n\r\nVarious code examples are provided [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Past courses:\r\n\r\n* [Bayreuth 2011](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/summer-school-in-bayreuth-17th-21th-of-september-2012-an-introduction-to-bayesian-modeling-for-ecologists/)\r\n* [Bayreuth 2012](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/summer-school-in-bayreuth-2nd-5th-of-august-2011-an-introduction-to-bayesian-modeling-for-ecologists/)\r\n* [Göttingen 2013](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/back-from-bayes/)\r\n* [Freiburg 2013](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/summer-school-on-bayesian-statistics-in-freiburg/)\r\n* [Bergen 2014](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/back-from-bayes-iv/)\r\n\r\nI will announce any upcoming courses [at my blog](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
