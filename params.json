  "body": "## Synopsis \r\n\r\nFor a few years, I have been teaching introductory course on Bayesian statistics together with various subsets of [Jörn Pagel](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/person/joern-pagel), [Joseph Chipperfield](http://josephchipperfield.wordpress.com/) and [Björn Reineking](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bjoern_Reineking), and [Felix May](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=32342). I will announce any upcoming courses [at my blog](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/).\r\n\r\n## Topics, lecture notes and code\r\n\r\nA collection of commented code examples on concepts and applications is here [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode). These example span the range of topics that we typically cover, including\r\n\r\n* Concepts of Bayesian statistics (Priors, Likelihoods, etc.). Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/01-Principles)\r\n* Sampling algorithms (MCMC, SMC). Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/02-Samplers)\r\n* The Bugs model language and its implementations in JAGS, STAN and OpenBugs. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/03-Software)\r\n* Standard statistical models with Bayes. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/04-StandardModels)\r\n  * (Generalized) linear models (G)LM\r\n  * (Generalized) linear mixed models (G)LMM\r\n* Advanced model types. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/05-HierarchicalAndSpatialModels)\r\n  * Spatial models \r\n  * State-space models \r\n* Bayesian model analysis and checks - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/06-BayesianModelChecking)\r\n* Model selection and averaging - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/07-BayesianModelSelectionAveraging)\r\n* Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/08-ApproximateBayesian)\r\n* Process-based models and Bayes - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/09-BayesAndProcessBasedModels)\r\n\r\nI'm working on providing proper lecture notes for this course. For the moment, I'm recommending as an introduction the free lecture notes [Bayesian Basics by Michael Clark](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/micl/miscfiles/IntroBayes.pdf). For further reading see the textbooks and articles suggested [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/LectureNotes/readings.md).\r\n\r\n## Past courses:\r\n\r\n* [Bayreuth 2011](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/summer-school-in-bayreuth-17th-21th-of-september-2012-an-introduction-to-bayesian-modeling-for-ecologists/)\r\n* [Bayreuth 2012](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/summer-school-in-bayreuth-2nd-5th-of-august-2011-an-introduction-to-bayesian-modeling-for-ecologists/)\r\n* [Göttingen 2013](http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/back-from-bayes/)\r\n* [Freiburg 2013](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2013/08/06/back-from-bayes-again/)\r\n* [Bergen 2014](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/back-from-bayes-iv/)\r\n* Leipzig 2015\r\n* Bergen 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
